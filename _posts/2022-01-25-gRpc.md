## RPC

*An RPC(Remote Procedure Call) is a response-response protocol like REST, but much different than REST. In RPC, we can make a procedure call in any instance of a computer connected in a network. This gives a huge benefit to us because we can directly execute functions and procedures that are in another device. We also do not need to request that device to know what procedures there are because gRPC specifically provides [reflection](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_server_reflection_tutorial.html) functionality. We can also use cli tools like [polyglot](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/polyglot), [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl), [evans](https://github.com/ktr0731/evans) etc.. and gui tools like [omgrpc](https://github.com/troylelandshields/omgrpc), [letmegrpc](https://github.com/gogo/letmegrpc) etc..*

Lets's discover what is gRPC, what technologies are being used underneath for it's core functionalities and how it may enhance the communication process in our applications. Since, I have already prepared some presentation before, regarding the matter, I am going to share those for shedding some light here.
