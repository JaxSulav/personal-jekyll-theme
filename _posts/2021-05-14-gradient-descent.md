# Gradient Descent

 Gradient Descent is an algorithm which is used to minimize the error with respect to the weights of a neural network. In a neural network training, our objective is to reach the minimal error point i.e we want the loss to be near to zero. We gradually adjust the weights by backpropagation algorithm which is based on gradient descent.
