## About

I am someone who likes to play around with interesting things and gets lost in the extensive thoughts. The bad side of me is that I don't even give a slightest bit to anything out of my scope of interest. In the meantime, I hope I will learn to cover that too. I like to share my knowledge to someone who wants to listen and to listen and learn from others. Technically, I work in a software field, possessing major and growing interest in machine learning approaches, ideas and alogrithms.
